### Activity A: Vocabulary Chart ðŸ“ˆ

1. **Instructions:** The next time you read an article or any technical content related to software development, create a vocabulary chart with three columns: "Unknown," "Passive," and "Active."

2. **Implementation:** As you read, identify technical terms or words that are new to you and list them under the "Unknown" column. If you encounter words you recognize and understand in context, but might struggle to explain, add them to the "Passive" column. Finally, include words you are familiar with and can confidently use under the "Active" column.
